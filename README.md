Quick Setup for Weather App:

1. Create an API key for Google places (autofill feature) and Google Maps (map feature).
2. Combine the links into a single script tag as one src link at the bottom of the index page.
3. Install Node.js to allow you to run the server (download and use nodemon to have your server run even after changes)
4. In the source directory run npm init -y and then npm install express
5. Run using node server.js or use nodemon server.js if you are using Nodemon.
6. It's that easy! Express is used for simple routing and external style sheets, which is accessed within server.js from your node_modules folder with const express = require('express');
